**Effective date:** [EFFECTIVE_DATE]  
**App name:** Bounty Budget  
**Developer:** [DEVELOPER_NAME] (“we”, “us”)  
**Contact:** [SUPPORT_EMAIL]

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Bounty Budget mobile application (the “App”). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the App.

---

## 1) The App and eligibility
Bounty Budget is a personal finance tracking app that lets you manually record accounts, transactions, and budgets. The App is not intended for children under 13.

You are responsible for ensuring your use of the App is lawful in your jurisdiction.

---

## 2) No financial advice
The App may provide budgeting tools, summaries, and AI-generated insights. All content and outputs are provided **for informational and educational purposes only** and **do not constitute professional financial, investment, legal, or tax advice**.

You are solely responsible for verifying any information and for decisions you make. Do not rely on the App or AI outputs as a substitute for advice from qualified professionals.

---

## 3) AI features (OpenAI) — important terms
### 3.1 Optional features + consent
The App includes optional AI-powered features (e.g., voice transaction parsing and financial insights). These features may send user-provided content to third-party AI providers (currently OpenAI) via our proxy services (e.g., Cloudflare Worker).

You must accept the in-app AI User Agreement before using AI features. If you do not want data processed by AI providers, do not enable or use AI features.

### 3.2 User content responsibility
You control what you enter into the App. **Do not enter sensitive personal information** (e.g., SSN/government ID numbers, full card numbers, bank account/routing numbers, medical information) in transaction notes, account names, or other free-form fields. If you include such information, it may be processed by AI features you use, and you do so at your own risk.

### 3.3 Accuracy limitations
AI outputs may be incorrect, incomplete, outdated, or misleading. You agree not to use AI outputs for high-stakes decisions without independent verification.

### 3.4 Acceptable use of AI features
You agree not to use AI features to generate, request, or submit content that is unlawful, harmful, infringing, deceptive, or that violates the rights of others. We may restrict or disable AI access if we reasonably believe AI features are being abused, used unlawfully, or used in a way that creates security or safety risks.

## 4) Subscription terms (auto-renewing; managed by Apple)
Bounty Budget uses subscriptions for access to certain App features and/or “Pro” functionality.

### 4.1 Free trial
If offered, a free trial lasts **7 days** (unless otherwise shown in the App Store or purchase flow). Trial availability, duration, and eligibility may vary by region and may change.

### 4.2 Billing and renewal
Subscriptions are processed by **Apple App Store**. Pricing and billing period (monthly/annual) are shown in the purchase flow and may vary by region/currency.

Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period, your subscription will **auto-renew**, and your Apple ID account will be charged through Apple.

If you start a free trial, **Apple may automatically convert it to a paid subscription** unless you cancel before the trial ends.

### 4.3 Managing and canceling
You can manage or cancel your subscription in iOS:
**Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**  
(or via the App Store subscriptions page).

Deleting the App does not automatically cancel your subscription.

### 4.4 Restoring purchases
If you reinstall the App or switch devices, you can restore access using Apple’s restore mechanism (e.g., “Restore Purchases”) as available in the App.

### 4.5 After trial / if you don’t subscribe
If you do not subscribe after the trial ends, access to subscription features may be restricted. Your data remains on your device, and you can subscribe later to restore access.

### 4.6 Price changes and plan changes
Apple may change prices, taxes, or billing terms, or require you to confirm acceptance of certain changes. We may modify subscription plans or features from time to time (for example, adding, removing, or changing features), but we will aim to present updated information in the App and/or App Store listing.

### 4.7 Refunds
Refund requests are handled by Apple under App Store policies. We do not provide refunds directly.

## 5) Your data and privacy
Our Privacy Policy explains how data is handled, including sharing with OpenAI, Mixpanel (analytics), RevenueCat (subscription management), and Apple (speech recognition and purchases). The Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms by reference.

---

## 6) Permissions and third-party services
Some features require device permissions (e.g., microphone, speech recognition, notifications). You can deny or revoke permissions in iOS Settings, but features may not work properly.

Third-party services may have their own terms and policies. Your use of those services is subject to their terms.

## 7) Acceptable use
You agree not to:
- Use the App in violation of any law or regulation

We may suspend or terminate access (including AI features or subscription entitlements) if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms, or if required by law.

## 8) Intellectual property
The App and its content (excluding your user-entered content) are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.

## 9) User content
You retain ownership of content you enter into the App (“User Content”). You grant us a limited license to process User Content solely to operate the App, including providing AI features and improving functionality.

## 10) Data loss and device responsibility
The App stores your financial data primarily on your device. You are responsible for maintaining access to your device and for any device-level backups you choose to enable.

## 11) Disclaimers
THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

---

## 12) Limitation of liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.
